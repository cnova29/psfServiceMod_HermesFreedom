PSFreedom - PS3 Jailbreak linux kernel
by KaKaRoTo

----
PSFreedom is a Linux kernel module and should work on most Linux devices with
a controller supporting slave mode and that allows us to access and modify
the USB Address of the controller.
The MUSB, MSM72K  musb driver to access the address of the usb and modify it.

Please check the wiki for a list of compatible devices, how to use PSFreedom,
how to contribute and how to port it to new devices : http://wiki.psfreedom.com/wiki/

To compile, first make sure that the pl3 submodule is correctly fetched and compiled then
type 'make <platform>' inside the platform's SDK environment.


====== How to Use PSFreedom =====
- First, you need to know if PSFreedom works on your device, so go to the
  Device compatibility list (http://wiki.psfreedom.com/wiki/Device_compatibility_list)
  and verify that your device is in there 
- Once you found your device in the list, and it is set as 'Complete, then click on
  the device name in the wiki page to go to that device's page 
- Follow the device specific instructions for getting PSFreedom on your device. 
- Once you're ready, turn the switch off in the back of your Playstation 3 or unplug the power cord. 
- Make sure there are no other USB devices plugged into the PS3 (USB Stick, Sixaxis Controller, etc.). 
- Then plug in your device and plug in the power cord of the PS3 or flip the switch back on. 
- Once you have that done, quickly press the power then immediately after press the eject button (as fast as you can). 
- You will know it work when it takes a slightly longer time (about 5 seconds more) to turn on. 
- The PS3 should boot up and you will see two new options in the games portion of the XMB (cross media bar). 
- That's it, you've rooted your PS3, and you are ready to install Homebrew applications! 
- You can now safely disconnect your device and return it to normal operation mode while enjoying this exploit.

 
====== How to Use Asbestos for devices that cant delay port switch (iPhone/iPod) =====
By now, asbestos only works for 3.41 FW.
To load asbestos on no_delayed_port_switching USB controllers (like iPhone/iPod) you need to run PSFreedom twice:
1 - Insmod psfreedom.ko and load asbestos stage1 like any normal payload:
      insmod psfreedom.ko
      echo 3.41 > /proc/psfreedom/fw_version
      cat asbestos_stage1.bin > /proc/psfreedom/payload
2 - Insmod psfreedom.ko again, immediately, loading asbestos stage2 by insmodding psfreedom with param: asbestos=1
      insmod psfreedom.ko asbestos=1
      cat asbestos_stage2.bin > /proc/psfreedom/asbestos_stage2
